        <h2 class="stbmm-article-h2">Motivation</h2>
        <p class="stbmm-article-content">
            A dataset is matrix in math language. Many modern machine learning 
            models use matrices to encode the information required to solve a 
            problem; these matrices are often multiplied with vectors many millions 
            of times during the training process, which makes finding efficient 
            algorithms for performing these multiplications a task of great practical 
            interest. Generally speaking, matrix-vector multiplication takes 
            <i>quadratic</i> time and space. However, in the case of N-gram 
            matrices (a popular feature representation used in natural language models), 
            there exist techniques to perform this operation in <i>linear</i>
            time and space. In this article, we explore the mechanics and 
            inspiration for these techniques, and, along the way, probe the 
            surprisingly deep connections $$X$$ between N-gram matrices and generalized 
            suffix trees.

        <p class="stbmm-article-content">
            Before we begin, let’s address the possibility of matrix-vector multiplication in linear space and time.
        </p>
        <h3 class="stbmm-article-h3">Cursory Analysis</h3>
        <p class="stbmm-article-content">
            In terms of space, if we're trying to store a $$3 \times 3$$ matrix, 
            shouldn't this take 9 units of memory? Similarly, if we're trying to store 
                a $$4 \times 4$$ matrix, shouldn't this take 16 units of memory? 
                More generally, if we wanted to store an $$n \times n$$ matrix, 
                shouldn't this take $$n^2$$ units (a quadratic amount) of memory?
                <br>
                <br>
            In terms of time, if we're trying to multiply a $$3 \times 3$$ matrix 
            with a $$3 \times 1$$ vector, don't we need at least 9 multiplications 
            and 6 additions? Similarly, if we wanted to multiply a $$4 \times 4$$ 
            matrix with a $$ 4 \times 1$$ vector, don't we need at least 16
            multiplications and 12 additions? More generally, if we 
            wanted to multiply an $$n \times n$$ matrix and an $$n \times 1 $$
            vector, don't we need at least $$n^2$$ (a quadratic number) 
            multiplications and $$n(n-1)$$ (also a quadratic number) additions?
                <br>
                <br>
        Are we on a wild goose chase? Or is our analysis somehow incorrect?
                <br>
                <br>
            Rest assured, our analysis is <i>not</i> incorrect, but it 
            <i>does</i> assume that we're working with <i>arbitrary</i> matrices. 
            It most definitely takes quadratic space to store an <i>arbitrary</i>
             matrix and quadratic time to multiply an <i>arbitrary</i> matrix with a 
             vector. But if we restrict ourselves to matrices with a linear 
             number of nonzero entries-a type of <i>sparse</i> matrix-then what 
             we want is indeed possible. Let's see why.
        </p>
        <h3 class="stbmm-article-h3">Storing Matrices in Linear Space</h3>
        <p class="stbmm-article-content">
            If we only have a linear number of nonzero entries, the overwhelming 
            majority of the entries are zero. Where there's a lot of redundancy, 
            there's a lot of potential for compression. In particular, 
            instead of explicitly storing every entry of a matrix $$M$$, 
            let's only explicitly store the nonzero ones; the zero entries can 
            be stored <i>implicitly</i>. One can imagine implementing this with 
            a hierarchical map $$\mathcal{M}$$ with two layers of keys.
        </p>
            <ul class="stbmm-article-ul">
                <li class="stbmm-article-li">
                    <b>Layer 1:</b> The first key into $$\mathcal{M}$$ represents 
                    the row of a matrix. That is, $$\mathcal{M}[i] = M_i$$.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Layer 2:</b> The second key into $\mathcal{M}$ represents 
                    the column of a matrix. That is, $$\mathcal{M}[i][j] = M_{ij}$$.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p class="stbmm-article-content">
            In particular, we only add the nonzero entries into map $$\mathcal{M}$$. 
            If the map doesn't have an associated value when the first key is 
            $$r$$ and the second key is $$c$$, then we know that $$M_{rc} = 0$$. In 
            this manner, we've successfully stored the nonzero entries implicitly
            without consuming space for them. Because we only have a linear number
            of nonzero entries by assumption, storing such a matrix only takes 
            linear space.
        </p>
        <h3 class="stbmm-article-h3">Multiplying Matrices in Linear Time</h3>
        <p class="stbmm-article-content">
            Given the representation of sparse matrices described in the previous
            section, it's not too difficult to see that we can matrix-vector 
            multiplication in linear time. Specifically, since the zero entries 
            would not have contributed meaningfully to the result anyways, we 
            can simply loop over the entries of $$\mathcal{M}$$, multiply them with the 
            corresponding element in the vector, and then aggregate the results.
            <br><br>
            Because we loop over a linear number of nonzero entries, and perform 
            a constant amount of work for each entry, this also takes linear time 
            overall. The conclusion, then, is that if we have a matrix with a linear 
            number of nonzero entries, then we can both store the matrix in linear 
            space and multiply it in linear time. The question then becomes: 
            do N-gram matrices obey this constraint?
        </p>

        <h2 class="stbmm-article-h2">Basic Terminology</h2>
        <p class="stbmm-article-content">
            Before we can answer this question, let's define what an 
            N-gram matrix is. Along the way, we pick up a few other 
            pieces of terminology and notation.

            sequence of characters $$d_i$$ and a corpus $$C = \{D_1, D_2, \dots, D_M\}$$ 
            is a set of documents $$D_i$$. For instance, below are some examples of documents. 
            Collectively, they form a corpus.

        <h2 class="stbmm-article-h2">Using Suffix Trees to Understand N-gram Matrices</h2>
        <p class="stbmm-article-content">
            At this point we've established that if we can somehow reformulate 
            an N-gram matrix in terms of a sparse matrix, then we can store it 
            using linear space and multiply it in linear time. This section is 
            about how this is possible. But first, let's see how we can use 
            suffix trees to answer essential questions about N-gram matrices. 
            In the following sections, let $$S$$ be an N-gram, $$D$$ be a 
            document, and $$T$$ be the suffix tree for $$D$$.
        </p>
        <h3 class="stbmm-article-h3">Does $$S$$ Appear in $$D$$ ?</h3>
        <p class="stbmm-article-content">
            First of all, what does it mean for $$S$$ to <i>appear</i> in $$D$$? 
            One way to think about this is that $$S$$ appears in $$D$$ if $$S$$ is a 
            substring of $$D$$, but this just begs the question: what does it mean 
            for $$S$$ to be a substring of $$D$$? The Fundamental Theorem of 
            Stringology tells us that $$S$$ is a substring of $$D$$ if and only if 
            $$S$$ is a prefix of a suffix of $$D$$. While being quite the tongue-twister, 
            this theorem is incredibly useful. Why? Recall that the suffixes of 
            $$D$$ are formed by concatenating the characters along a root-leaf 
            path in $$T$$. So, $$S$$ is a prefix of a suffix of $$D$$ only if we 
            don't fall of the tree when using the characters of $$S$$ to traverse 
            $$T$$. This leads to an extremely intuitive algorithm for finding 
            out whether $$S$$ appears in $$D$$.

        <h3 class="stbmm-article-h3">How many times does $$S$$ appear in $$D$$ ?</h3>
        <p class="stbmm-article-content">
            By the Fundamental Theorem of Stringology, this is equivalent to 
            the question: how many suffixes of $$D$$ is $$S$$ a prefix of? 
            Just like before, let's use $$S$$ to navigate $$T$$. The suffixes 
            which $$S$$ is a prefix of can be constructed by appending to $$S$$ 
            the characters along the remaining paths to leaf nodes (assuming 
            we stay on the tree, otherwise the answer is trivially zero). 
            Because the remaining number of distinct paths to leaves is 
            exactly equal to the remaining number of leaves, the number of 
            times $$S$$ appears in $$D$$ is equal to the number of leaves in the 
            subtree rooted at $$S$$. This can be found efficiently 
            with a simple depth-first traversal.

        <h2 class="stbmm-article-h2">8. Multiplying N-gram Matrices in Linear Space and Time</h2>
            <p class="stbmm-article-content">Alas! Our journey has come to an end; everything is in place to discuss how we can multiply $$N$$-gram matrices in linear space and time. To be pedantic, this technique doesn't apply to arbitrary $$N$$-gram matrices but specifically to node matrices ($$N$$-gram matrices without redundant columns). This isn't really a limitation, however, because, as mentioned in section 5.1, this is almost always what we want.</p>

            <h3 class="stbmm-article-h3">8.1 Computing $$\mathcal{X}w$$ in Linear Space and Time</h3>
                <p class="stbmm-article-content"> We saw in section \ref{linear-dependencies} that if $$p$$ was a node in $$T$$ and $$c_1, \dots, c_n$$ were its children, then $$\mathcal{X} = \sum_i \mathcal{X}_{c_i}$$. This is an interesting observation, but what does it have to do with efficient matrix-vector multiplication? Well, let's assume for the moment that $$p$$ and $$c_1, \dots, c_n$$ were the only nodes in our generalized suffix tree. This means that our node matrix might\footnote{Any permutation of the columns would be an equally valid node matrix.} look something like</p>
                
                <div class="stbmm-article-equation">$$\mathcal{X} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathcal{X}_{c_1} & \dots & \mathcal{X}_{c_n} & \mathcal{X}_p \end{pmatrix}.$$</div>

                <h5 class="stbmm-article-h5">8.1.1. Reformulating the Operation</h5>
                 
                    <p class="stbmm-article-content">Let's see what insights we might derive by actually multiplying the corresponding matrix with a vector $$w$$, recalling that matrix-vector multiplication can be thought of as a linear combination of the matrix columns.</p>
                    
                    <div class="stbmm-article-equation">
                    $$\begin{align*}
                        \mathcal{X} w &= w_{c_1}\mathcal{X}_{c_1} + \dots + w_{c_n}\mathcal{X}_{c_n} + w_p\mathcal{X}_p\\
                        &= w_{c_1}\mathcal{X}_{c_1} + \dots + w_{c_n}\mathcal{X}_{c_n} + w_p\sum_i \mathcal{X}_{c_i}\\
                        &= (w_{c_1} + w_p)\mathcal{X}_{c_1} + \dots + (w_{c_n} + w_p)\mathcal{X}_{c_n}
                    \end{align*}$$
                    </div>

                    <p class="stbmm-article-content">Notice that the only columns that remain are the columns that correspond to the children of $$p$$. In fact, we can reformulate $$\mathcal{X} w$$ as $$\Phi \beta$$ where $$\Phi$$ and $$\beta$$ are defined in the following manner.</p>

                    <div class="stbmm-article-equation">
                    \begin{align*}
                        \Phi &= \begin{pmatrix} \mathcal{X}_{c_1} & \dots & \mathcal{X}_{c_n} & 0 \end{pmatrix}\\
                        \beta &= \begin{pmatrix} w_{c_1} + w_p & \dots & w_{c_n} + w_p & 0 \end{pmatrix}^T
                    \end{align*}
                    </div>

                    <p class="stbmm-article-content">This insight—the ability to reformulate our original operation in terms of a different matrix and vector—is a general one and is not limited to the specific example considered above. The interpretation of this result is that we don't <i>actually</i> need to multiply any of the columns corresponding to an internal node $p$ of $$T$$; we can \textit{simulate} this by passing the number we would've needed to multiply $$\mathcal{X}_p$$ by—$$w_p$$—down to $$p$$'s children.</p>

                <h5 class="stbmm-article-h5">8.1.2. Analyzing the Space and Time Complexity</h5>

                    <p class="stbmm-article-content"> In general, the only nonzero columns in matrix $$\Phi$$ are going to be the ones that correspond to the leaves in $$T$$. Because there are a linear number of leaves in a suffix tree, there are a linear number of nonzero columns in $$\Phi$$. Since leaves correspond to suffixes and each suffix can only belong to one document (due to the unique sentinels we appended to each document during the construction of $$T$$), each of these columns has exactly one nonzero entry. This means that $$\Phi$$ satisfies the sparsity condition described in section \ref{mv_mult_in_linear_time}, which allows $$\Phi$$ to being stored in linear space and multiplied in linear time. Constructing $$\beta$$ can also be done in linear time by performing a simple top down traversal of the suffix tree, which has a linear number of nodes. </p>

            <h3 class="stbmm-article-h3">8.2. Computing $$\mathcal{X}^Ty$$ in Linear Space and Time</h3>

                <p class="stbmm-article-content">Depending on the context, it may be necessary to multiply the transpose of the node matrix instead. This can also be done in linear time. To see why this is the case, let's reuse the setup from section \ref{computing_Xw}.</p>

                <div class="stbmm-article-equation"> \[\mathcal{X}^T = \begin{pmatrix} \mathcal{X}_{c_1} & \dots & \mathcal{X}_{c_n} & \mathcal{X}_p \end{pmatrix}^T\] </div>

                <h5 class="stbmm-article-h5">8.2.1. Reformulating the Operation</h5>

                    <p class="stbmm-article-content"> Let's see what insights we might derive by actually multiplying $$\mathcal{X}^T$$ with a vector $$y$$, recalling that matrix-vector multiplication can be thought of as taking the dot product of the matrix rows with the vector $$y$$. </p>

                    <div class="stbmm-article-equation">\begin{align*}
                        \mathcal{X}^T y &= \begin{pmatrix} \mathcal{X}_{c_1}^Ty & \dots & \mathcal{X}_{c_n}^Ty & \mathcal{X}_p^T y \end{pmatrix}^T\\
                        &= \begin{pmatrix} \mathcal{X}_{c_1}^Ty & \dots & \mathcal{X}_{c_n}^Ty & (\sum_i \mathcal{X}_{c_i})^T y \end{pmatrix}^T\\
                        &= \begin{pmatrix} \mathcal{X}_{c_1}^Ty & \dots & \mathcal{X}_{c_n}^Ty & \sum_i \mathcal{X}_{c_i}^Ty  \end{pmatrix}^T
                    \end{align*} </div>

                    <p class="stbmm-article-content"> This insight suggests that we can simply compute the dot products for the children and simply add them together to get the value in the output vector corresponding to the parent. In contrast to the previous section where the tree traversal was top-down and performed before the multiplication takes place, we now have to traverse the tree bottom-up and do this as the multiplication is taking place. </p>

                <h5 class="stbmm-article-h5"> Analyzing the Space and Time Complexity </h5>

                    <p class="stbmm-article-content"> We've already address why $$\Phi$$ takes a linear amount of space to store. All that remains is analyzing why this operation takes linear time to compute. It takes a constant amount of time to multiply such vectors. Since we need to perform a linear number of such multiplications because there is a linear number of leaves, this takes linear time. Filling out the other entries of the result vector with a bottom up traversal of the suffix tree also takes linear time because it involves just adding a constant number of things.</p>



        <!-- Section 9 -->
        <h2 class="stbmm-article-h2">9. Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="stbmm-article-content">The $$N$$-gram matrix, a critical component of many popular machine learning models in the field of natural language processing, can be represented in linear space and multiplied in linear time. This is done by first recognizing and removing redundant N-grams which leaves us with a node matrix $$\mathcal{X}$$, and then resolving the linear dependencies between the remaining columns which leaves us with a leaf label matrix $$\Phi$$ which has a linear number of nonzero entries; these kinds of matrices can be represented in linear space and multiplied in linear time. Multiplying $$\mathcal{X}$$ with a vector $$w$$ requires transforming $$w$$ into $$\beta$$ via a top down traversal of the corresponding generalized suffix tree, propagating weights downward. Multiplying $$\mathcal{X}^T$$ with a vector $$y$$ requires a bottom up traversal of the corresponding generalized suffix tree, propagating intermediate results upward. None of these incredible improvements would have been possible without having recognized and explored the intimate relationship between N-gram matrices and generalized suffix trees.</p>
